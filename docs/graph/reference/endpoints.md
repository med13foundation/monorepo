# Graph Endpoints

This document inventories every currently supported route in the standalone
graph service.

Exact request and response schemas live in `services/graph_api/openapi.json`.
Use this document for route discovery, access expectations, and capability
grouping.

## Access model

- `none`
  No authentication required.
- `member`
  Any authenticated caller with access to the graph space.
- `researcher+`
  Researcher, curator, admin, owner, or `graph_admin`.
- `curator+`
  Curator, admin, owner, or `graph_admin`.
- `graph_admin`
  Service-local control-plane admin claim.
- `member + graph_admin`
  The caller must be a graph-space member and also carry the `graph_admin`
  claim.

Feature-flagged routes:

- `GRAPH_ENABLE_ENTITY_EMBEDDINGS`
  Required for entity similarity and embedding refresh.
- `GRAPH_ENABLE_RELATION_SUGGESTIONS`
  Required for constrained relation suggestions.
- `GRAPH_ENABLE_HYPOTHESIS_GENERATION`
  Required for automatic hypothesis generation.
- `GRAPH_ENABLE_SEARCH_AGENT`
  Enables optional agent-assisted graph search. The route itself remains
  available even when the flag is off.

## Contract Notes

- The platform app no longer publishes supported graph APIs under the
  `/research-spaces/{space_id}/` prefix.
- The generated OpenAPI artifact at `services/graph_api/openapi.json` is the
  schema-level contract source of truth.
- Generated TypeScript consumers should use
  `src/web/types/graph-service.generated.ts`.
