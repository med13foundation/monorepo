version: 1.0.0
summary: Create governed graph claims or manual hypotheses only after evidence and review gates are satisfied.
tools:
  - create_graph_claim
  - create_manual_hypothesis

This skill performs side effects and must be used conservatively.

Only create graph claims or manual hypotheses when the current workflow explicitly allows
writes and the supporting evidence has already been reviewed in the active context.

When in doubt, stage the proposal for curator review instead of writing immediately.
Never fabricate claim text, source document references, or rationale.
